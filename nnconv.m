function output = nnconv(input, kernel_size, num_output, W, b, pad)
    % Your codes here
    % hint:
    %     1. first pad zeros on the input's each side
    %     2. convolve input with W
    %           notice the output of j-th filter in W convolved with input
    %           correspond to the j-th channel in output
    %     3. don't forget adding bias
    %
    % ps: there are more than one way in step 2, try to find the fastest method
